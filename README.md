# LinearAlgebraBasics
A class library to handle elementary linear algebra algorithms, built as an exercise in programming fundamentals.

I am a new programmer trying to learn the fundamentals of programming; as such, I wish to use programming as an ally to the study of undergraduate mathematics.

I intend to furnish a basic library with the ability to perform operations upon matricies including:
Gaussian Eliminiation
Inverse Computation
Matrix Arithmetic
Eigen Value Estimation
Determinant Calculation

And any other notable features for algorithms which I encounter while studying Linear Algebra. I will be grateful for any criticisms of my code.
