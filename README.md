# LinearAlgebraBasics
A class library to handle elementary linear algebra algorithms, built as an exercise in programming fundamentals.

I wish to use programming as an ally to the study of undergraduate mathematics.

I intend to furnish a basic library with the ability to perform operations upon matricies including:
Gaussian Eliminiation,
Inverse Computation,
Matrix Arithmetic,
Eigen Value Estimation,
Determinant Calculation

and any other notable features or algorithms which I encounter while studying Linear Algebra. I will be grateful for any criticisms of my code.
